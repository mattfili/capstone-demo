          Project Goals:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
              Get all sorts of proficient with Angular / MVC coding patterns and learn a few new modules 
          </li>
          <li>
              Get a functioning proof of concept going for an application I've had in mind
          </li>
          <li>
              Actually bring something pretty to the table (I tend to fixate on the technical / not stick to my original plan)
          </li>

          Lessons Learned:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Don't wait until you feel proficient to get cracking on your dream project (but never the capstone, those will wait)
            I started two weeks ago, pitched it in a formal diligence round Sunday, and changed more code than I wrote; never too soon to build cool stuff 
          </li>
          <li>
            Start with a clear and attainable goal in mind and structure your approach, it's very easy to get caught in tangents
          </li>
          <li>
            Pitch the technical side of your project to your teacher first.  I spent three days building a screen parser for a headless browser which ended up 86'ing.
          </li>
